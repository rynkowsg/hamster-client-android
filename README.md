Hamster Client for Android [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rynkowsg/hamster-client-android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rynkowsg/hamster-client-android)
==========================

A mobile app addressed to users of existing linux desktop application - Hamster Time Tracker.
Same as desktop app, Hamster Client allows a time tracking.
It means the app stores data about user activities in time.

The application allows the user to connect to their desktop
and synchronize data between Hamster Client and Hamster Time Tracker.

More information about Hamster Time Tracker you can find at [project's website][projecthamster]
and [GitHub page][projecthamster-github].



Libraries
---------

 * [ButterKnife][butterknife]
 * [Dagger 2][dagger2]
 * [Lombok][lombok]
 * [RxJava][rxjava]

Project provides communication with host by D-Bus. In order to do that I used:

 * [dbus-java][dbus-java] - D-Bus library for Java
     (the library was modified for the project purpose)
 * libmatthew-java - a dependency of dbus-java ([link1][libmatthew-java-1],
     [link2][libmatthew-java-2], [link3][libmatthew-java-3], [link4][libmatthew-java-4]).



The Clean Architecture
------

At the project I have applied [The Clean Architecture][the-clean-architecture]
proposed by Robert C. Martin.

About Android approaches of The Clean Architecture you can read [here][the-clean-way]
and [there][progmag-ca]. You can also look at two another existed implementations
made by [Fernando Cejas][android-cleanarchitecture] and [Micha≈Ç Charmas][shoppinglist].
